## Introduction

In crypto, volatility isn't the enemy â€” it's *the environment*.  
Most trading bots break because they chase patterns in noise, mistaking randomness for rhythm.  

But what if you could build an agent that **reads the market like a thermodynamic system**?  
That's the heart of my approach: **entropy-aware Q-learning**, guided by **holonic structure** and supported by hybrid indicators.

This is not just quant strategy. It's **adaptive philosophy** encoded in code.

## Architecture

### ðŸ§  Holonic Q-Learning  
Rather than treating the agent as a single mind, I design **multi-scale holonic agents** â€” micro-agents nested within macro-structures.  
Each layer focuses on different resolutions:  
- One watches the short-term momentum,  
- Another maps macro-trends,  
- A third reacts to meta-volatility.

This nesting allows the system to **self-correct** and **self-reflect**.

### ðŸ“‰ Entropy Signals  
The reward function is sensitive not just to profit but to *volatility gradients*.  
This enables the agent to modulate risk behavior â€” acting conservatively in low entropy, and more aggressively in high entropy.  
Entropy becomes a **heuristic compass**, not just noise.

## Example: Entropy-Modulated Reward

<div class="font-elegant text-mystic mb-2">Edit and run the reward function live below:</div>
<LiveCode initial={`function reward(state, action, entropy) {\n  return baseReward(state, action) + entropy * 0.42;\n}\n\nfunction baseReward(state, action) {\n  return state + action;\n}\n\n// Try it:\nrender(<div>Reward: {reward(2, 3, 1.5)}</div>);`} height={140} />
