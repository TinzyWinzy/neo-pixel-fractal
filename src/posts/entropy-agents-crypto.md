## Introduction

In crypto, volatility isn’t the enemy — it’s *the environment*.  
Most trading bots break because they chase patterns in noise, mistaking randomness for rhythm.  

But what if you could build an agent that **reads the market like a thermodynamic system**?  
That’s the heart of my approach: **entropy-aware Q-learning**, guided by **holonic structure** and supported by hybrid indicators.

This is not just quant strategy. It’s **adaptive philosophy** encoded in code.

## Architecture

### 🧠 Holonic Q-Learning  
Rather than treating the agent as a single mind, I design **multi-scale holonic agents** — micro-agents nested within macro-structures.  
Each layer focuses on different resolutions:  
- One watches the short-term momentum,  
- Another maps macro-trends,  
- A third reacts to meta-volatility.

This nesting allows the system to **self-correct** and **self-reflect**.

### 📉 Entropy Signals  
The reward function is sensitive not just to profit but to *volatility gradients*.  
This enables the agent to modulate risk behavior — acting conservatively in low entropy, and more aggressively in high entropy.  
Entropy becomes a **heuristic compass**, not just noise.

```js
function reward(state, action, entropy) {
  return baseReward(state, action) + entropy * 0.42;
}
