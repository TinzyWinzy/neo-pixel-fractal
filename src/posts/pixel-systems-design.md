## Introduction  
In an age of glassmorphism and blurred abundance, **pixel systems** offer a different kind of luxury: *clarity*.  
This post explores why I often design within the pixel grid — not as an act of nostalgia, but as a ritual of control, intention, and *memory coding*.

## Design Approach

- **Intentional Alignment**  
  Every pixel is a promise. Every misalignment, a fracture in the system. When I build interfaces, I treat each square as a decision — no padding left to chance.

- **Fractal Padding**  
  I space elements with recursive rhythm — padding that scales like Fibonacci, not fashion. Each margin echoes its parent.  
  The layout becomes a *visual algorithm*.

- **Retro Logic**  
  Simplicity is not regression. It’s clarity through constraint.  
  In retro UIs, the logic is transparent — what you see is what the system *is*. No illusion, no abstraction without necessity.

## Example: Pixel Grid System

```css
.pixel-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(8, 1fr);
  gap: 2px;
}
