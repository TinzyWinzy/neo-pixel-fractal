## Introduction  
In an age of glassmorphism and blurred abundance, **pixel systems** offer a different kind of luxury: *clarity*.  
This post explores why I often design within the pixel grid — not as an act of nostalgia, but as a ritual of control, intention, and *memory coding*.

## Design Approach

- **Intentional Alignment**  
  Every pixel is a promise. Every misalignment, a fracture in the system. When I build interfaces, I treat each square as a decision — no padding left to chance.

- **Fractal Padding**  
  I space elements with recursive rhythm — padding that scales like Fibonacci, not fashion. Each margin echoes its parent.  
  The layout becomes a *visual algorithm*.

- **Retro Logic**  
  Simplicity is not regression. It's clarity through constraint.  
  In retro UIs, the logic is transparent — what you see is what the system *is*. No illusion, no abstraction without necessity.

## Example: Pixel Grid System

<div class="font-elegant text-mystic mb-2">Edit and run the pixel grid CSS live below:</div>
<LiveCode initial={`.pixel-grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(8, 1fr);\n  gap: 2px;\n}\n\nrender(<div className=\"pixel-grid\">{Array.from({length: 64}).map((_,i) => <div key={i} style={{background:'#7755aa',height:24}} />)}</div>);`} height={120} />

/* Pixel grid: Foundation for precise, retro UI systems. */
.pixel-grid { /* ... */ }
