## Introduction
Who is *White Half Moon*?

More than a pen name — it’s an invocation. A cipher. A midpoint between creation and collapse. Between symbol and system.

This post is the first ember in a series for **Neo-Pixel Fractal**, my personal and professional universe of curated entropy, fluid design, and intelligent code. This is where identity, nature, and computation converge into a single thread of *intentional chaos*.

## Philosophy

- **Balance**  
  Code is not just logic — it’s rhythm. Fire is not just destruction — it’s calibration. Balance is the tension between two states: *the pixel and the flame*, *the script and the spark*.

- **Identity**  
  I wear masks to reveal truths. The name “White Half Moon” is both *mirror and metaphor*. The moon never shows its full face — neither do we. Yet every reflection offers data.

- **Creation**  
  Systems are biographies in disguise. Every function I write, every fractal I frame, every AI agent I build — they are all coded self-portraits. This is not work. This is *ritual*.

## Example: Fire Function
```js
function ignite(identity) {
  return `${identity} burns with purpose.`;
}

// Output:
ignite("White Half Moon"); // "White Half Moon burns with purpose."
