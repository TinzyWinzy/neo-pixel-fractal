> “Let them bloom—autonomous agents in a garden of thought.”

## Introduction

A new paradigm for collaborative AI: the **agent garden**. This design leverages Firebase Studio and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create a living, evolving knowledge ecosystem—where agents grow, connect, and adapt like plants in a garden.

## System Architecture

**Key Components:**
- **Agents:** Autonomous, persistent, context-aware
- **Memory:** Vector search and RAG for long-term context
- **Communication:** Real-time via Firebase
- **Orchestration:** CAG (Contextual Agent Garden) for multi-agent workflows

**Holonic Structure:**
Agents are nested—micro-agents inside macro-agents—enabling self-correction and emergent behavior.

## Live Demo: Blooming Agent Garden

Below, interact with a live agent garden. Click "Bloom" to grow new agents. Watch as they connect and form a living system.

## Example: Agent Bloom
```js
function bloom(agent) {
  return agent.grow("garden");
}
```

## Key Benefits
- Scalable, real-time collaboration
- Modular, holonic agent design
- Knowledge grows organically—like a true garden

## How to Start Your Own Agent Garden
1. Set up Firebase Studio
2. Implement agent modules (micro and macro)
3. Integrate RAG for memory
4. Orchestrate with CAG
5. Visualize and iterate—let your agents bloom

## Next Steps
- Integrate advanced memory modules
- Open source the garden for community expansion
- Explore cross-garden agent communication
