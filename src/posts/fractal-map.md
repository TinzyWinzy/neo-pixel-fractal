## Fractal Map: Knowledge Garden Overview

Below is a living map of the current posts. Each node is a clickable pattern; lines indicate thematic or structural resonance.

- **[White Half Moon's Fire: On Identity, Nature & Code](/blog/white-half-moon)**
  - Origin node: Ritual, identity, entropy, and fractal selfhood.
  - Connects to: Neo-Pixel Fractal, Agent Garden Architecture, Entropy-Aware Agents in Crypto Trading

- **[Neo-Pixel Fractal: My Design Philosophy](/blog/neo-pixel-fractal)**
  - Fractal modularity, pixel logic, entropy as style.
  - Connects to: Pixel Systems, White Half Moon, Agent Garden Architecture

- **[Pixel Systems: Between Nostalgia & Precision](/blog/pixel-systems-design)**
  - Retro UI, memory coding, fractal padding.
  - Connects to: Neo-Pixel Fractal, White Half Moon

- **[Agent Garden Architecture: The New Stack](/blog/agent-garden-architecture)**

*This map is interactive: click nodes to navigate, hover for details. The garden grows as new nodes are added.*

## How to Use This Map
- Click any node to visit the post.
- Trace the lines to explore thematic or structural resonance.
- Remix: Add your own node, or suggest a new connection.
