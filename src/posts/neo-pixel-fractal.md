## Introduction

Why **pixel art**? Why **fractals**? Why embed entropy in design?

Because the digital world demands clarity without sterility, order without rigidity, and emotion without noise.

**Neo-Pixel Fractal** is my design language — a fusion of retro minimalism, recursive structure, and entropy-aware elegance. It's not a style. It's a *system of seeing* — one that turns user interfaces into **living systems**.

## Design Principles

### 🌱 Fractal Modularity  
Components nest like Russian dolls. Layouts ripple like Mandelbrot echoes.  
I design UI elements to repeat, reflect, and scale — so the interface behaves like a **living pattern**.  

*If the system grows, the pattern persists.*

### 🎯 Pixel Precision  
No soft shadows. No meaningless gradients. Just clear, honest blocks of form.  
Pixels offer constraints that *liberate intention*. A single misaligned pixel is a broken promise to the user.  

*Clarity is an act of respect.*

### 🔥 Entropy as Style  
Perfect symmetry is lifeless.  
I introduce randomness and irregular rhythm deliberately — to echo *natural systems*, prevent visual fatigue, and imbue interfaces with personality.

Entropy isn’t noise. It’s *texture*. It’s **digital breathing**.

## Example: Fractal Component

```jsx
function FractalBox({ depth }) {
  if (depth === 0) return <div className="pixel-box" />;
  return (
    <div className="pixel-box">
      <FractalBox depth={depth - 1} />
    </div>
  );
}
